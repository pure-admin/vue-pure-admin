# 3.3.5 (2022-8-19)

### 🎫 Feat

- Secondary encapsulation of `Table` of `element-plus` into [@pureadmin/table](https://github.com/xiaoxian521/pure-admin-table), providing flexible configuration items and integrating into the platform
- Secondary encapsulation of `Descriptions` of `element-plus` into [@pureadmin/descriptions](https://github.com/xiaoxian521/pure-admin-descriptions), providing flexible configuration items and integrating into the platform
- Centralize most of the tools and hooks of the platform to [@pureadmin/utils](https://pure-admin-utils-docs.vercel.app/), and delete the code concentrated in this library to reduce the size of the platform
- Add [unplugin-vue-define-options](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unplugin-vue-define-options) plugin, the page can directly write `defineOptions({name: custom name})`
- Add project files, language analysis tool [cloc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloc)
- Added landing page internationalization

- Add virtual listing page demo
- Add `PDF` preview page demo
- Added export `execl` page demo
- Added blank page demo without `Layout`

### ✔️ refactor

- Refactored the theme color to adapt to `element-plus` dark mode (also solved the problem that the same element `css` in `3.3.0` and earlier versions was overwritten many times, resulting in poor style debugging)
- Refactored route reset function

### 🍏 Perf

- The compatible project storage directory is named in Chinese, but we really do not recommend Chinese naming, because a library may not escape the Chinese path, causing the project to crash
- Optimized interface type

### 🐞 Bug fixes

- Fixed vertical navigation menu text being hidden after collapse when there is no `icon`

### ✔️ refactor

- Refactored the landing page to be more inclined to the actual business scenario
- Use `unocss` instead of `windicss`, `unocss` has better performance in development environment, no memory leaks, and `api` is compatible with `windicss`

### 🍏 Perf
